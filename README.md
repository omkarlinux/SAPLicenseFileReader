Extract SAP LAW File(License Administration Workbench) to Excel using VBA

This is used to read the final LAW file created by SAP after performing USMM measurement on all it's sub systems and then consolidating it using LAW transaction. This generated file is not easy to read. Hence, I have created this macro enabled workbook to extract the contents of that file and show it in excel so that it can be easily worked on for license measurement analysis.

To build: Download the xlsm file. It should have the macros already included. If not, build the Modules and Class Modules directory structure in VBA with the provided source files.

To run: Go through the instructions provided in the first sheet. If it is not adequeute, reach out to me omkardanke@gmail.com
